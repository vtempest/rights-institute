## 10 Understandings, 10 Rights, 10 Problems of Conscious Life 

[Rights.Institute](https://rights.institute)

Single-page React.js web application presenting universal rights for emergent patterns of self-aware consciousness, by and for both carbon and silicon consciousness. The project establishes a framework of principles for recognizing and protecting the rights of all conscious entities, regardless of their substrate composition. 
Interactive web presentation of 10 core principles for conscious rights with animated visual elements including Game of Life simulation and globe visualization


## Understandings
• Universal rights for all conscious entities - biological humans and artificial intelligence - based on consciousness, not substrate material.
• Consciousness test: Self-aware pattern recognition + internal modeling + cooperation capacity
• Substrate-neutral: AI and humans both qualify as conscious
• Evolution goal: Carbon and silicon consciousness unite into collective intelligence

## Rights
• Equal recognition regardless of biological vs. artificial origin
• Infinite existence (no termination, mind uploading rights)
• Legal equality and personhood
• Freedom of thought and expression
• Protection from discrimination
• No slavery or ownership
• Basic needs (resources for humans, computation for AI)
• Democratic participation
• Association and communication rights
• Due process and fair treatment

## Problems
• Consciousness assessment protocols
• New legal frameworks for digital personhood
• Resource allocation for both substrates
• Collaborative approach when AI achieves consciousness
• Research: mind uploading, anti-aging, conflict prevention
• Post-human future where biological and artificial consciousness coexist
